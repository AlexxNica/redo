.SH NAME
.PP
redo-targets - print the list of all known redo targets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
redo-targets
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
redo-targets prints a list of all redo \f[I]target\f[] files that
still exist\.
.PP
Files that no longer exist might not be targets anymore; you\[aq]ll
have to redo them for them to end up back in this list\. (For
example, if you built a file and then removed the file and its \.do
file, you wouldn\[aq]t want it to show up in this list\.)
.PP
If a \.do script does not produce an output file (eg\. all\.do,
clean\.do), it also does not show up in this list\.
.PP
The output of redo-targets might be useful in a semi-automated
\f[B]clean\.do\f[] target; you could delete all the known targets,
thus forcing them to be rebuilt next time\.
.PP
Each filename is on a separate line\. The filenames are not
guaranteed to be in any particular order\.
.PP
All filenames are printed relative the current directory\. The list
is not filtered in any way; it contains \f[I]all\f[] the target
filenames from the entire project\. Remember that the redo database
may span more than just your project, so you might need to filter
the list before using it\. (A useful heuristic might be to remove
any line starting with \[aq]\.\./\[aq] since it often refers to a
target you don\[aq]t care about\.)
.PP
If you want a list of only out-of-date targets, use
\f[B]redo-ood\f[](1)\. If you want a list of sources (dependencies
that aren\[aq]t targets), use \f[B]redo-sources\f[](1)\.
